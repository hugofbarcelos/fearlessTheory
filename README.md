<AC_> Bootcamp #65 - Hackathon - Jorge, Verceira, Pacheco, Abano, Diniz

## Name
Hackathon project [Fearless Theory] done for <AC_> Bootcamp #65 24h challenge

## Description
This project explores two thematics (Overcoming fear with humor) and the Sitcom (The Big Bang Theory). It consists of a planetary main menu view that then redirects to two other pages, one with a fear selector that then gives mechanisms to cope with that fear, and another page that consists of a mini-video game where an astronaut is lost in space and you need to help him get back to ship using humor!
